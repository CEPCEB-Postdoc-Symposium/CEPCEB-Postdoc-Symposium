      <p class="speakers-bio">Ryan began studying insects as an undergraduate researcher at the University of California, Berkeley, where he conducted biochemical experiments testing a new mutagenesis technique in Drosophila melanogaster. After graduating, he attended graduate school at the University of California, San Francisco, where he began studying the neurons that mediate insect behaviors, with the goal of understanding how agricultural pests interact with their environment and ultimately select locations for egg-laying, foraging, and feeding. Specifically, under the guidance of Dr. Ulrike Heberlein, he investigated competing egg-laying and feeding preferences in Drosophila for ecologically-relevant chemicals that are present in fermenting fruits, and his findings helped establish egg-laying site selection as a model for decision making in Drosophila. After receiving his Ph.D., Ryan continued to study the neural basis of insect feeding behaviors during his postdoctoral fellowship at Yale University. Under the supervision of Dr. John Carlson, he identified a critical neuron in the Drosophila pharynx that expresses a unique taste-receptor not present elsewhere in the fly. Surprisingly, he discovered that although this neuron is responsive to sugars like sucrose, activation of this sweet-sensitive cell leads to the suppression of consumption, rather than the promotion of feeding. These findings demonstrated a new type of circuit logic in how insects inhibit feeding behaviors. Upon completion of his fellowship, Ryan subsequently joined Dr. Anupama Dahanukar’s laboratory at the University of California, Riverside, where he has continued his investigations into feeding suppression in Drosophila, in order to better understand neural pathways that could lead to advances in the control of environmental and agricultural insect pests.</p>

      <p class="speakers-bio">After I got my MSc diploma from Wageningen University, Wageningen, Netherlands I started as a graduate student at Utrecht University, Utrecht, Netherlands. In the group of Prof. Dr. Sjef Smeekens I studied post-transcriptional gene regulation in response to carbon availability in Arabidopsis. I investigated the sucrose-induced repression of translation (SIRT) mechanism on the bZIP11 mRNA and changes in ribosome heterogeneity in response to a high sucrose treatment. In May of 2011, I became a postdoctoral scholar in the group of Dr. Julia Bailey-Serres at UC Riverside. As post-doctoral scholar I was involved in the Arabidopsis 2010: Deciphering mRNP Networks project in which we studied the role of under characterized or uncharacterized RNA binding proteins in post-transcriptional gene regulation in Arabidopsis in response to abiotic stresses. Although most of my studies I have performed in Arabidopsis, more recently as an assistant project scientist, I got involved in different projects that study post-transcriptional gene regulation in different plant model species such as rice and maize. At the symposium I will present my studies on how a plant balances translation and sequestration of mRNAs in response to energy availability.</p>

I got my Ph.D. degree in July 2011 and subsequently I joined Dr. Meng Chen's laboratory as a Postdoctoral Associate in the Department of Biology at Duke University, Durham, NC. I continued my research as an Assistant Project Scientist in Dr. Meng Chen's laboratory after the lab moved to University of California, Riverside in late 2015. My project in Dr. Meng Chen's laboratory focuses on understanding the detailed mechanism of phytochrome signaling in regulating light- and temperature-mediated plant growth.</p>
